Inclusion Exclusion Principle : 

Count Number in range from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3 or 4 . 

Count Binary Strings of length n that begin or end with 0 . 

Derangement Count : Example 1 2 3 now position of 1 is 1 , 2 is 2 , 3 is 3 . So we want that number of derangement possible such that number is not its orignal position . 


Union of Multiple Coinditions : 

So First Example C1 : Divisible by 3 , C2 : Divisible by 4 , Some numbers will be common and added twice . so - N(C1 ∩ C2)
N (C1 U C2) = N(C1) + N(C2) - N(C1 ∩ C2)
